# tss-director

TSS usually have multiple parties, in order to make all the parties work with each other , it need to pass messages from one to another, usually this is not a problem , we could use a P2P network , but we want to make TSS to work on mobile phones(IOS/android) , which usually doesn't allow any inbound connections.  We need a service that can facilitate the communication , and responsible of passing the necessary messages around.
